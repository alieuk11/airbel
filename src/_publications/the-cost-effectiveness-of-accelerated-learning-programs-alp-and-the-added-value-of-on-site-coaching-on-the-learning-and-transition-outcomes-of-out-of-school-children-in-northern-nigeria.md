DFID EiE NFLC project was funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) to support out-of-school (OOS) children in the states of Yobe and Borno in Nigeria with their education and psychosocial well-being. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Creative are working to provide OOS children between the ages of 9-14 with quality learning opportunities to develop basic literacy and numeracy skills, heal from the traumatic effects of displacement and violence, and transition into formal schools. During two years of intervention, about 20,000 eligible OOS children will receive structured instruction in literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional learning (SEL).&nbsp;

Researchers from the IRC are conducting a mixed methods, randomized control trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program on the learning and transition outcomes of OOS children in northern Nigeria, and the added value of providing on-site coaching visits to learning facilitators.
