      This month, the mental health team wrapped up the idea generation phase of
      work with the development of five initial prototypes. These prototypes aim
      to:&nbsp;


      1. bridge information gaps;

      2. scale the number of care providers;

      3. integrate mental health service provision into existing business
      models; and

      4. help people learn to identify mental health needs on their own.


      Testing of these prototypes will begin in the new year.

      Eight problem areas arose from various sources, including community-driven
      [Mahali lab](https://medium.com/airbel/mahali/home){: target="_blank"},
      and work in the Jordan and Lebanon country offices. These areas were:
      urban housing, mental health, cash targeting, market interventions,
      voluntary returns, information flows, healthcare service delivery, and
      smart humanitarianism. IRC-Zolberg Fellows and IRC staff carried out desk
      research along with discussions with community members.

A growing body of research points to the outsized impact of mental health issues in the refugee population. Common mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to double during emergencies, and tend to impact the most vulnerably most powerfully. Mental health issues and poverty also form a self-reinforcing cycle which can make it challenging for people to rebuild after facing trauma.

Most refugees live in low-income countries, where only 2 percent of health providers are trained in mental health. In Jordan, even prior to the Syria crisis, the WHO estimated that the country faced a shortage of well over 1,000 mental health professionals. Mental illness remains a taboo with significant cultural barriers to identifying challenges and seeking care.

Some key areas in which support can be provided includes:

* Basic services and security, including food, shelter and access to clean water.
* Community and family support, such as family reunification, creation of child friendly spaces, and activation of social networks.
* Focused non-specialized support, such as individual, family or group interventions, and ongoing care through community-based primary health care systems.
* Specialized services, including clinical mental health care and specialized support for psychiatric disorders and trauma.

There is increasing evidence that “non-specialist workers in primary-care and community settings can deliver mental health care with great effectiveness to a variety of populations.”. Therefore, opportunities for innovation may exist around:

1. Standardizing outcomes and developing culturally sensitive assessment tools;
2. Better articulating core principles for integrating mental health in various activities, such as social connections, exercise, and mindfulness; and
3. Developing new business models to incentivize community members to effectively deliver mental health support.
