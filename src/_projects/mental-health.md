      Our Facebook campaign reached people over 1.406 million times in Jordan,
      and we had a cumulative reach of about 1,900 people on WhatsApp. Over the
      course of the campaign, 47 posts were shared, including three Facebook
      Live events facilitated by a mental health & psychosocial support expert.
      Results show that:&nbsp;


      * Posts related to stress and anxiety got much more engagement than posts
      related to depression

      * Shorter videos delivered by experts were the most successful, with
      videos discussing somatic symptoms, or physical symptoms, amassing the
      highest view count&nbsp;

      * The more relatable the content is for the target audience, the more
      likely they are to engage with the post, underscoring the importance of
      community-driven content

      This Facebook and WhatsApp campaign is designed to run for a period of
      five weeks, with each week dedicated to a theme (anxiety, depression,
      somatic symptoms, types of services, and psychological support to loved
      ones). Updated elements from the previous iteration of this prototype
      include:


      * **Storytelling at the core.** In our rapid evidence review, we found
      that [storytelling can be
      effective](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0890117119825525d#:~:text=Research%20has%20shown%20that%20a,and%20improve%20grades%20in%20students.&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20one%20study%20revealed,health%20behaviors%2C%20like%20blood%20pressure)
      in changing health behaviors. We designed several different characters
      that would resonate with our target audience and used those characters to
      design and send out 5-7 posts per week.

      * **Behavioral principles**, such as including simple and direct actions
      and framing content as “helping others” to destigmatize seeking help, were
      incorporated while designing the campaign content.&nbsp;

      * **Chatbots.** In order to scale, we started using the
      [Turn.io](https://www.turn.io/) platform to help us create a WhatsApp
      chatbot to automatically manage hundreds of chats.&nbsp;

      We engage Jordanian community members from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and Yemen
      to test and iterate on the content of the next campaign, with the aim of
      making our content relatable and appropriate in a way that is appealing.
      This ensures our content would be effective prior to launch and allow us
      to focus on using our tools to reach as many people as possible.

      We conduct a rapid evidence review on social media campaigns around mental
      health to compile best practices from similar interventions. A couple of
      key takeaways include:&nbsp;&nbsp;


      * Sharing examples of people successfully seeking help increases trust and
      promotes help-seeking behaviors. This is especially true for
      men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      * Training people to support others can also encourage individuals to seek
      help

      Over 3000 people responded to our survey, and the campaign cumulatively
      reached 437k people on Facebook and several hundred people through
      Whatsapp. Initial findings showed that:


      * Sharing timely and relevant information led to high engagement and
      organic sharing amongst family and friends, even after the ad campaigns
      concluded.

      * Ensuring two-way communication engagement on social media led to
      informal information swapping amongst community members, promoting the
      de-stigmatization of mental health issues and providing a forum for
      sharing coping-skills.

      * The IRC was trusted as a source of information and our clients were
      generally comfortable spreading the information we shared to their family
      and friends.

      In response to COVID-19 in Jordan, we are fast-tracking the testing of the
      InforMH prototype

      The Jordanian government imposes a strict lockdown in the wake of
      COVID-19, and we begin a Facebook and WhatsApp campaign aimed at helping
      people address mental health needs. The campaign includes an online survey
      seeking information on how the lockdown is impacting people's wellbeing
      and what kind of wellbeing-related information they need. The aim of this
      campaign is to generate engagement and community by encouraging people to
      share their own wellbeing tips so others like them in similar situations
      can receive help. The topics covered in this campaign include emergency
      helplines and peer videos; how to beat boredom; wellbeing tips; sleep
      hygiene tips; and guidelines for providing psychological first aid to
      friends and family.

      This month, the mental health team wrapped up the idea generation phase of
      work with the development of five initial prototypes. These prototypes aim
      to:&nbsp;


      1. bridge information gaps;

      2. scale the number of care providers;

      3. integrate mental health service provision into existing business
      models; and

      4. help people learn to identify mental health needs on their own.


      Testing of these prototypes will begin in the new year.

      Key barriers to accessing mental health treatment were identified, along
      with some initial ideas for solutions. Some of the barriers identified as
      most pressing included:


      * lack of trained service providers

      * people’s lack of awareness about mental health issues

      * stigma around mental health issues

      * limited trust in services

      * confidentiality

A growing body of research points to the outsized impact of mental health issues in the refugee population. Common mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to double during emergencies, and tend to impact the most vulnerable most powerfully. Mental health issues and poverty also form a self-reinforcing cycle which can make it challenging for people to rebuild after facing trauma. Mental illness remains a taboo with significant cultural barriers to identifying challenges and seeking care.

In March 2019, in response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jordanian government [imposed one of the strictest lockdowns](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/home-deliveries-humvees-life-under-jordan-harsh-coronavirus-lockdown){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the world, compounding mental health issues for the most vulnerable. In response, the IRC began prototyping a digital campaign, known as InforMH, aimed at bridging information gaps around mental health issues.

InforMH works by leveraging people’s social networks, where people often turn when they first experience mental health problems, to deliver messaging around mental health in a way that encourages help-seeking behavior. The purpose behind InforMH is to share and source mental health content that is community driven.&nbsp; This means we lean towards experts from the community, embrace dialogue and responsiveness in a scalable way, and put forward community-driven and -led solutions.
