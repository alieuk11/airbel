      The final report summarizes key lessons from this collaboration. In
      addition to the substance, we identified three success factors that
      determined the utility of our analysis.

      Triggers are the ‘moments that matter’ in a crisis, when funding and
      action are needed. Through this project we identified that additional
      funding for IRC operational teams would be needed when (i) COVID-19
      surged; (ii) the policy context changed, including stay-home orders and
      border closures; or (iii) stocks of key supplies, like personal protective
      equipment, reached critical thresholds. Perhaps most importantly,
      additional funds would be needed when costs associated with each of the
      above moments could not be met through existing budgets - it was these
      *residual* funding needs that mattered most.

      Analysis of how IRC raised, managed, and deployed its emergency funds
      during COVID-19 complete, identifying important spending patterns and
      innovations. For example, IRC established an innovative earmarked
      contingency fund with light-touch governance to support rapid country
      program investments that protected staff and client safety, adapted
      programming, and initiated start-up activities for larger scale response.
      This accelerated action in some cases by months.

COVID-19 has sparked a complex, multifaceted, and likely protracted global humanitarian crisis.&nbsp; Crisis risk financing approaches attempt to identify the risk that funds will be needed in the future and prepare financing in advance. This project is a first step towards developing a practical and pragmatic blueprint for how organizations can systematically re-orient more of their resources and processes towards a state of readiness for future crises.
