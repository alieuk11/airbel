      A series of workshops have been held together with key local actors,
      including with Signpost, Mercy Corps and Stanford Immigration Policy Lab.
      Two ideas for further exploration have emerged: natural language
      processing and machine learning and how communication spreads through
      community.

      Of the eight areas in which initial scoping was conducted, four were
      selected: voluntary and spontaneous returns; mental health; urban housing;
      and information flows.

      Eight problem areas arose from various sources, including community-driven
      [Mahali lab](https://medium.com/airbel/mahali/home){: target="_blank"},
      and work in the Jordan and Lebanon country offices. These areas were:
      urban housing, mental health, cash targeting, market interventions,
      voluntary returns, information flows, healthcare service delivery, and
      smart humanitarianism. IRC-Zolberg Fellows and IRC staff carried out desk
      research along with discussions with community members.

Displaced people live in challenging circumstances where accurate information can become difficult to obtain. Strengthening information flows can aid in decision-making and make their circumstances easier to manage.

Displaced people find themselves in a new environment where they might not know local laws, or how to access crucial services like healthcare, education, or employment. Research shows that refugees want timely, case-specific information from a trusted source. Unable to access this information, people often rely on informal networks. But access to reliable information has the potential to help displaced people organize and effectively respond to events that shape their lives, and can prevent rumors and anxiety within displaced populations, particularly in moments of transition.

While humanitarian organizations have invested substantially in improving operational information management, additional investment is required to strengthen our ability to provide crucial information to displaced populations. But providing refugees with valid, actionable, and timely information is no easy challenge. Available services and policies can shift swiftly, and the sheer number of actors in the space makes a complete picture difficult.

There are several main areas which have key opportunities to improve information flows. One is to strengthen, replicate, or scale what’s working, including Facebook pages and information sessions. Another is to reframe touchpoints with refugees – such as home visits and hotlines – as opportunities to share, receive, and react to information and information needs. Finally, efforts can be undertaken to leverage online and in-person networks, as well as to detect and respond to rumors.
