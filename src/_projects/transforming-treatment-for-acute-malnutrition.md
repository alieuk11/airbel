  IRC is proposing a suite of five approaches to simplify treatment for acute
  malnutrition and to make it more accessible. Alongside an ambitious advocacy
  campaign, they have the potential to transform the way children with acute
  malnutrition are treated.

      UN leaders publically committed to developing a Global Action Plan on
      Wasting and to updating WHO treatment guidelines. This commitment
      represents critical progress toward policy reform. The IRC played a key
      role in generating the political will needed to make this statement.

      In Mali and Chad, UNICEF, WFP and ECHO endorse the combined protocol for
      further exploration and unite to fund and organize a large-scale,
      multi-country pilot of the combined protocol. These pilots will generate
      additional evidence from which the IRC will drive meaningful policy change
      and produce programmatic guidance.&nbsp;

      Working closely with partners Action Against Hunger and the London School
      of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the IRC implemented a randomized
      controlled research study (RCT) in Kenya and South Sudan to test a
      combined protocol to treat children with SAM and MAM. Preliminary results
      from the trial suggest that the combined protocol is not only successful
      at recovering children with both SAM and MAM to full recovery, but can do
      so at a lower cost.

      The IRC conducted a prospective cohort study to test an adapted protocol
      for treating SAM in Somalia using RUTF dosage based on the treatment
      protocol implemented in the ComPAS research trial in Kenya and South
      Sudan. To further understand requirements for adaptation and adoption of
      the combined protocol in different contexts, the IRC also conducted a
      policy analysis on the use of the protocol in five different food-crisis
      affected contexts.&nbsp;

      The IRC has piloted and tested delivering treatment through community
      health workers which enables families to access care directly in the
      communities they live, from providers they know. To make this feasible,
      the IRC designed and developed simplified tools to support even
      low-literate CHWs to accurately diagnose and treat acute malnutrition.

      secondary data analysis of 10,000 acutely malnourished children to propose
      a new optimized dosage of RUTF to treat SAM and MAM.&nbsp;

Acute malnutrition is a continuum condition meaning a child’s condition improves or deteriorates continuously along a single spectrum. Today, children suffering from acute malnutrition are divided into two different categories based on the severity of their illness: severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).&nbsp; This impacts what kind of treatment they access, where treatment is available to them, and far too often, whether they can access treatment at all.&nbsp;

Treatment for SAM and MAM is rarely available at the same place and time and in many locations, treatment for MAM is not available at all, meaning children must wait until their health deteriorates before accessing the care that they need. Worse still, the treatment for both conditions is currently available only in formal health facilities putting the burden on families to traverse long, often dangerous distances, to reach the life-saving care their children desperately need. &nbsp;

This system is inefficient and makes it difficult for children to access the care they need.&nbsp; In fact, less than 20% of acutely malnourished children receive the treatment they need to fully recover.&nbsp;

### **The five interventions**

1. **Combined, simplified treatment of SAM and MAM:** Under a combined approach**,** children with SAM and MAM are treated together in the same physical location, using a tailored dose of one product. This is simpler for health providers to implement and relies on fewer treatment products to deliver the same health gains.&nbsp;
2. **Delivering Care Through Community Health Workers (CHWs):** TheIRC has piloted and tested the feasibility of delivering treatment through community health workers, which enables families to access care directly in the communities they live from providers they know. The IRC designed and developed simplified tools to support even low-literate CHWs to accurately diagnose and treat acute malnutrition.
3. **Parents Monitoring and Diagnosing Malnutrition at Home:** Several clinical trials and operational studies have shown caretakers can be trained to accurately diagnose malnutrition in their own children. Empowering caretakers to manage the screening process allows children to be identified and referred to care more quickly.
4. **Locally-sourced and Produced Ready-to-use Foods:** Ready-to-use food (RUF) makes it possible for children to be treated in their own homes. These products are typically produced in/shipped from Europe and the United States. Locally-sourced and produced RUF would allow more children to be treated for less cost.
5. **Integrating Treatment and Prevention:** The IRC is testing a series of strategies to prevent malnutrition in vulnerable communities. The next step is integration – linking families of malnourished children with resources to prevent malnutrition from reoccurring.

### **Where we are now**

The IRC is generating evidence around these innovative approaches. Our research and pilot studies already suggest that these approaches are feasible and can have a transformative impact on the lives of children around the world.&nbsp;

The IRC is also leading and ambitious advocacy campaign to ensure these approaches will be endorsed, adopted into policies and guidelines, and adequately financed. This requires elevating acute malnutrition as a priority for global donors, targeting stakeholders from peer organizations, and working directly with the U.N. to build the consensus and political will needed to see these approaches put into action.
