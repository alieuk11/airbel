  The current malnutrition treatment is inaccessible for 4 out of 5 acutely
  malnourished children globally. A new combined approach is simpler, less
  expensive, & offers more comprehensive treatment, with the potential to reach
  more children at scale.

      Study showed that stakeholders in Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan
      were strongly supportive of providing treatment for both forms of
      malnutrition at the same location. However stakeholders also raised
      concerns around the proposed diagnostic criterion prioritizing mid-upper
      arm circumference over weight-for-height z‐score and supply pipeline
      issues potentially affecting the availability of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic
      Foods. More research is needed on the clinical efficacy and operational
      implications of the Combined Protocol.

      Analysis found that a simplified, combined protocol could enable a more
      holistic continuum of care, potentially contributing to increased coverage
      for children suffering from acute malnutrition. This study analyzed data
      from Chad, Kenya, Yemen, Pakistan, and South Sudan.

      secondary data analysis of 10,000 acutely malnourished children to propose
      a new optimized dosage of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to treat
      Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM).

Globally, [approximately 50 million children](https://data.unicef.org/resources/jme-report-2020/){: target="_blank"} suffer from acute malnutrition at any given time, including nearly 18 million children the IRC estimates living in conflict and crisis-affected contexts. A cure exists – a simple package of peanut-based paste, delivered through daily doses over a few months – but the system to deliver it is broken, making treatment inaccessible for 4 out of 5 children globally. The IRC, in partnership with Action Against Hunger and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, have developed a new approach that offers the promise of simpler, less expensive, and more comprehensive treatment.

Acute malnutrition is a continuum condition meaning a child’s condition improves or deteriorates continuously along a single spectrum. Under the current system, malnutrition is divided into two categories based on severity and treated with two different products in health facilities that are often too distant for families to access. This divided protocol impacts what kind of treatment children can access, where treatment is available to them, and far too often, whether they can access treatment at all.

This simplified protocol treats all acutely malnourished children with the same food product and in the same place, adjusting dosage based on severity. This approach was found to be as effective at recovering children as the traditional treatment method, and offers significant cost savings. It is also simpler for health workers and ensures children are treated before they deteriorate into the more dangerous form of severe malnutrition.

*This is one in a suite of solutions the IRC is proposing to create a future in which every malnourished child is treated. Current interventions are overly complex and institutionalized. Our approach empowers families and community health workers to deliver a simplified protocol for treatment with an easy-to-use toolkit. This is a package of care that can be adapted to different contexts, rolled out quickly during times of emergency, and scaled across humanitarian crises.*
