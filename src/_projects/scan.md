    description_markdown: >-
      * The Consortium will begin making SCAN 2.0 available for other NGOs,
      expanding the pool of users producing rigorous cost analyses.&nbsp;

      * We will leverage the sharing of meaningful data in multiple sectors, and
      improve the use of limited resources in the delivery of health, education,
      and cash services to the most people in need.

    description_markdown: >-
      * Finalized 2.0 software to fit any NGO’s finance system. Case studies of
      SCAN analyses show the value of cost-efficiency data.

      * Developed future governance model and licensing plan as network of SCAN
      users grows. Created cost recovery plan for hosting and maintenance.

      A proof-of-concept pilot with five NGOs shows that the SCAN approach is
      applicable and meaningful, helping them identify more than &pound;80,000
      in efficiency gains for beneficiaries.

      The SCAN tool is initially developed by the IRC, and piloted with country
      programs in Chad, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, and Pakistan. Pilots show that
      SCAN enables rigorous analysis in a fraction of the time that it would
      take by hand.

Humanitarian organizations do not routinely use cost data to compare the efficiency or effectiveness of different interventions and delivery models. This is because existing methods to calculate cost-efficiency are inconsistent and time-consuming, creating opportunity for error. And the data that is available cannot be meaningfully compared. As a result, policymakers and practitioners have little data with which to make informed decisions about where money should be spent in a humanitarian response.

SCAN, or the Systematic Cost Analysis tool, simplifies the process of conducting cost analyses for field staff. SCAN calculates the full cost per output for an individual activity and compares it with other projects to identify opportunities for cost improvement. It also provides guidance on strategies to improve cost-efficiency based on existing studies.

The IRC, together with Mercy Corps, Save the Children, Action Against Hunger Spain, and CARE USA, have formed a consortium to jointly develop, pilot, and launch the multi-agency tool. The consortium will develop forums in which data can be shared to spread the learning agenda and address key questions in program value for money.

#### **How does it work?**

1. **Step-by-step methodology for non-experts in low-resource settings.** SCAN streamlines the formerly time-consuming and complex process of conduct cost analyses, enabling non-expert field staff to easily input the best information available on how program resources were spent in the field.
2. **Automatically uses available transaction data in existing finance systems.** By automating data collection, the time needed to conduct a cost analysis can be reduced from several days to a few hours, minimizing the extra burden on field staff’s daily work.
3. **Consistently categorizes and calculates costs incurred.** Standardizing the analytical structure and embedding the methodology in an online tool ensures that all analyses will meet common methodological standards, allowing the results to be meaningfully compared.These insights help humanitarian and development actors make use of limited resources in a transparent and effective way.
