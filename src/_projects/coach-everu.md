      Goal: “Design a flexible and durable learning and teaching experience that
      dramatically improves a child’s acquisition of Social and Emotional
      Learning (SEL) and literacy in their primary school years”
---

#### Why focus on Social-emotional learning?

Social-emotional learning, or “SEL”, can help children develop the skills needed to regulate their emotional responses, positively interact with others and better persevere in adverse situations.

####  

#### How does it work?

* Training and coaching sessions occur during 1-hour weekly video clubs.
* Refugee teachers implement what they learned in their classroom during daily designated ‘SEL time.’
* Teachers are rewarded and supported with localized SEL cards that signal they are trained SEL teachers and can be used as teaching aids in the classroom.
