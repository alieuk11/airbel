      Prototyping sprint takes place in Tanzania to test three mobile-based
      concepts. One focused on caregivers, one on youth, and one - which later
      became Coach Erevu - on teachers. The sprint aimed to understand current
      technology use, feasibility and desirability of different mobile channels
      of delivery, and validating the concept of teaching SEL through different
      parties.

      Coach Erevu begins with the goal to: “design a flexible and durable
      learning and teaching experience that dramatically improves a child’s
      acquisition of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and literacy in their
      primary school years”
---

#### Why focus on Social-emotional learning?

Social-emotional learning, or “SEL”, can help children develop the skills needed to regulate their emotional responses, positively interact with others and better persevere in adverse situations.

####  

#### How does it work?

* Coaching sessions and peer-to-peer learning occur during 1-hour weekly video clubs.
* Refugee teachers implement what they learned in their classroom during daily designated ‘SEL time,’ marked by a school bell.
* Teachers are rewarded and supported with localized SEL cards that signal they are skilled SEL teachers and can be used as teaching aids in the classroom.
