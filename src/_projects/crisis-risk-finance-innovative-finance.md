    IRC’s work on crisis risk finance seeks to develop a blueprint for how
    organizations can reorient more of their resources and processes to be
    better prepared for, and how the international humanitarian system finances
    response to, complex crises.

            Building on the broader crisis-risk financing blueprint developed by
            the IRC and CDP this document provides a deeper understanding of
            trigger components, their linkages to crisis-risk financing, the
            trade-offs, and nuances to consider and lays the foundation for
            applicability of triggers with programs. It provides a step-by-step
            approach to the trigger design action using a Human-Centered Design
            model, and offers recommendations and ideas for operationalization
            entry points.<br>&nbsp;

            This report is the final output of the IRC-CDP Decision-making
            During COVID-19 project, and presents an analysis of IRC financing
            response to COVID-19 as well as trigger identification and
            selection, laying the foundation for further risk-informed
            financing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

The IRC is a leader in crisis risk financing, generating evidence to support a proactive approach to humanitarian financing. Crisis risk finance seeks to use insurance principles to pre-arrange financing and operational plans before crises erupt, so we can act more quickly and effectively when they do. We see opportunities to prepare financing for natural hazards, public health emergencies and even more complex risks, like conflict and displacement.&nbsp;

Triggers are the foundation of any crisis risk financing framework. In this context, we use ‘trigger’ simply to mean the moments during a crisis in which action and associated funding are required. Good trigger design is about articulating these moments clearly to guide technical analysis and instrumentation. Any funding decision or operational action in a crisis risk financing framework can be linked to foreseen but uncertain events (risks) using triggers. These actions could include the release of financing from donors, insurance instruments, or internal contingency funds to finance operational activities or staff deployments.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Though a trigger-based approach is relatively a new focus, IRC has pioneered rapid response financing for complex humanitarian emergencies for over a decade, for example, through its flagship Crisis Response Fund (CRF) and, more recently, its COVID-19 Central Fund to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic (IRC, 2020). The organization is generating and taking lessons from these rapid response programs to inform the next frontier by using risk analysis to inform financial preparedness and ensuring that funds are deployed in the right place at the right time and for the right purposes.&nbsp;
