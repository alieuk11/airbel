  Global humanitarian budgets are not keeping pace with our clients’ needs and
  aspirations. Airbel is designing and testing new approaches to raising
  finance, and impactful new ways to use funds before, during and after conflict
  episodes.

      This report is the final output from the Defining and Driving Innovative
      Finance for Humanitarian Response project. The project was funded by USAID
      and delivered by the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) Airbel Impact
      Lab, and sought to contribute to more efficient and effective financing
      systems for humanitarian response by (i) mapping the innovative finance
      landscape, (ii) designing new innovative finance instruments and
      approaches, and (iii) contributing to the emerging community of practice.
      Building on recent progress in financing for natural disasters, we focused
      in this project on innovative finance for people affected by violent
      conflict.

      Building on extensive desk research, expert consultation, interviews with
      donor agencies and original data analysis, the landscaping exercise
      developed a new unified


      definition of innovative finance and mapped existing financing
      innovations. Findings from the exercise were shared with partners and are
      available on request ahead of publication later in 2020.

More than 500 million people live in a setting of fragility, conflict or violence; and by 2030, almost 350 million people will live in extreme poverty in these settings, constituting two-thirds of the extreme poor worldwide. Yet the financing deficit for people affected by violent conflict is growing, and what humanitarian finance is available tends to be short-term, fragmented, and slow to react when conflict erupts. Despite years of hype, the potential of new financing approaches for people affected by violent conflict remains largely unfulfilled.

The Defining and Driving Innovative Finance project, funded by USAID and implemented by IRC’s Airbel Impact Lab, aims to (i) map the fragmented innovative finance landscape; (ii) design pilot-ready financing innovations for people affected by violent conflict; and (iii) contribute to the emerging community of practice in this field.

This is the first project that aims to design new financing solutions for people affected by violent conflict, building on recent advances in financing for natural disasters. Airbel will develop innovative finance pilots in three areas. First, we will identify opportunities to use well-established financial instruments – like insurance – to save lives and livelihoods that would otherwise have been lost to violent conflict, shrinking the need for aid. Second, we will build a pipeline of investment opportunities that both improve lives and generate financial returns for investors, increasing the total amount and quality of finance available. Third, we will design new ways to make traditional humanitarian grants more efficient, effective, and catalytic, increasing the impact of every dollar available.
