Sesame Street and the IRC have partnered on Sesame Seeds, a historic initiative that will bring hope and opportunity to a generation of children affected by the Syrian conflict. Refugees around the world are displaced for an average of 10 years, and the humanitarian system struggles to support them. The humanitarian system is was created to respond to short-term problems and focus on meeting basic needs. Plus, only 2% of funding goes to education—and just a fraction to early childhood. Sesame Seeds is the largest early childhood intervention in the history of humanitarian response, combining an educational broadcast reaching 9.4 million children in the region with direct services for 1.5 million of the most vulnerable.

Few Syrian children have opportunities to learn and play; some have been exposed to extreme violence. They are at risk of “toxic stress,” a biological response to adversity that disrupts normal brain development. Sesame Seeds harnesses the unique strengths of IRC and Sesame Seeds to deliver early learning and care at scale. It combines high quality, research-driven educational content, engaging characters who connect deeply with children’s lives and experiences, and extensive on-the-ground operations to support families in fragile settings.

Sesame Seeds aims to help parents provide the care children need to overcome toxic stress, through in-person support as well as video and audio content. Community sites are transformed into nurturing care and learning centers. Frontline staff are trained, and centers equipped to provide support for managing and overcoming toxic stress. And finally, a locally-produced television show will introduce children to characters and role models who understand their experiences, including the Sesame Muppets. The show focuses on language, literacy, numeracy, and socio-emotional skills. Most of all, Sesame Seeds helps promote understanding—children spend time with characters that help them be smarter and kinder.
