      technology use, feasibility and desirability of different mobile channels
      of delivery, and validating the concept of teaching SEL through different
      parties.

In partnership with [Ubongo](https://www.ubongo.org/){: target="_blank"}, Africa’s leading children’s edutainment and media company, Tunakujenga aims to cultivate new learning behaviors in the family, focused on teaching children social emotional skills (SEL), such as [grit](https://www.characterlab.org/grit){: target="_blank"} and problem-solving skills. Leveraging the wide reach of television and existing faith-based networks to reach caregivers wherever they are, Tunakujenga builds on existing community practices to encourage family learning and SEL as part of their daily home routines.
