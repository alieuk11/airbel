      Began piloting the product’s core functions with the Atlanta office for
      user-testing, feedback, data collection and evaluation. The pilot was slow
      to roll out, due to low client arrival rates at the Atlanta office.

      The team visited the Seattle resettlement office to meet with staff and
      clients and understand the appetite for, feasibility of and adjustments
      needed to roll out the application in Seattle.

      The project to enhance communication between caseworkers and their clients
      begins, with the goal of building a light-touch SMS-based application.The
      Internal kickoff included key project stakeholders from the Airbel Center,
      USP, the Atlanta Resettlement Office and representatives from funder
      Twilio.org. The team walked through the project to collaboratively define
      the timeline, established context for the grant, aligned on pain points to
      solve for, planned for field visit to Atlanta and introduced the pieces of
      the prototype the team will begin to build.

From the moment refugees arrive in the United States, they have an overwhelming amount of paperwork, appointments, and deadlines they must keep track of in addition to adapting to a new cultural and physical environment. To assist them through this period, the IRC has a team of dedicated caseworkers.

To simplify this process and reduce strains on time and resources for both the caseworker and resettled refugees, Airbel — with the support of Twilio.org — is developing an SMS-based system that will serve as a single platform for all caseworker and client communications. Alleviating stress, lost time, and lowering the likelihood of miscommunication, this new tool further empowers caseworkers and improves the refugees’ experience of settling into their new home country.
