      Pilot begins in Wichita, Tucson, Dallas, Seattle, Tallahassee, and New
      Jersey. The aim is to reach over 100 users across the U.S. and conduct an
      evaluation to show improvements in resettlement outcomes for both clients
      and caseworkers.

      Piloting began to user test the platform, collect data and evaluate its
      performance. However, low refugee arrivals nationally, and a moratorium in
      Atlanta due to&nbsp;a lowering of the annual refugee ceiling for 2019
      meant that the solution couldn't be tested with enough cases. Some
      software issues identified.

      Project begins with a kickoff including key IRC stakeholders and
      representatives from funder Twilio.org. The team walked through the
      project to collaboratively define the timeline, established context for
      the grant, aligned on pain points to solve for, planned for a field visit
      to Atlanta and introduced the pieces of the prototype the team will begin
      to build.

From the moment refugees arrive in the United States, they have an overwhelming amount of paperwork, appointments, and deadlines they must keep track of in addition to adapting to a new cultural and physical environment. To assist them through this period, the IRC has a team of dedicated caseworkers.

To simplify this process and reduce strains on time and resources for both the caseworker and resettled refugees, Airbel — with the support of Twilio.org — is developing an SMS-based system that will serve as a single platform for all caseworker and client communications. Alleviating stress, lost time, and lowering the likelihood of miscommunication, this new tool further empowers caseworkers and improves the refugees’ experience of settling into their new home country.
