From the moment refugees arrive in the United States, they have an overwhelming amount of paperwork, appointments, and deadlines they must keep track of in addition to adapting to a new cultural and physical environment. To assist them through this period, the IRC has a team of dedicated caseworkers.

To simplify this process and reduce strains on time and resources for both the caseworker and resettled refugees, Airbel — with the support of Twilio.org — is developing an SMS-based system that will serve as a single platform for all caseworker and client communications. Alleviating stress, lost time, and lowering the likelihood of miscommunication, this new tool further empowers caseworkers and improves the refugees’ experience of settling into their new home country.
