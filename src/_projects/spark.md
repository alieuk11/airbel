The Spark concept is a youth-led program to create learning spaces outside of traditional classrooms. Youth would be trained through a digital platform to teach social-emotional skills in concentrated and interactive small group sessions. These youth leaders would receive backpacks filled with materials, lessons and activities for use in the learning circles. Spark was designed to work as an extension of school, involving teachers, or to exist completely separate from it.

Parents and community members would be involved throughout the learning process, with ample opportunities to learn about the program generally, and social-emotional learning specifically. Through the Spark Carnival, student accomplishments would be celebrated with the entire community.
