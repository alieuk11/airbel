  Airbel worked closely with colleagues in the Asia Region to prototype
  approaches to increasing diversity and inclusivity in our workplaces through
  mechanisms with wide appeal, that can be easily integrated into workplace
  routines.

      The Asia team concludes early prototyping and identifies a draft concept,
      comprised of an app, 2 card games, and a manual. They will use the
      micro-grant from Airbel to build these out and further test them.

Gender, power, and culture are familiar lenses used in the aid sector when thinking about programming. However, we don’t consistently turn those lenses on ourselves. The literature is rife with examples of gender bias in recruitment, workplace sexual harassment, and challenges women face in advancement. What is less obvious is how to counteract these issues, particularly in Asian workplaces, where the literature is silent. In recognition of these challenges, the IRC is conducting workshops, and undertaking efforts to roll out new guidance on areas such as hiring, protection, and HR policies.&nbsp;

In 2018, the IRC’s Asia Region leadership flagged gender inclusivity in the workplace as a regional priority. The Asia Region wanted to explore how to amplify the effect of existing gender initiatives by promoting a culture of inclusivity and diversity. Understanding how to start these conversations across diverse workplace cultures and in the face of myriad other work priorities was an open question.&nbsp;

The Asia Regional Director and Gender Advisor hypothesized that a game or an app could appeal to a broad audience, even to colleagues for whom gender is not a priority. We believed that to be effective, colleagues must be engaged for prolonged periods, without a need for training or facilitation. Game play is a growing area of exploration by social research institutions for shifting attitudes and behaviours, making it an interesting starting place for our work. The Asia team and Airbel collaborated to prototype different types of group, individual, digital, and analogue activities to better understand their appeal to colleagues in a work setting, as well as how they may be integrated into the workday. As a starting point, the team began looking at games which colleagues were already playing and how sensitive conversations happen in the workplace..
