When mass displacement leads to mass unemployment, both refugees and vulnerable host populations are affected.  Getting refugees into work, and growing the labor market, requires both innovative policy and innovative ideas. In 2016, the Government of Jordan and the international community forged the Jordan Compact, which aims to provide 200,000 employment opportunities to Syrian refugees. One part of the Compact is a set of incentives for employers to hire refugees. To support the Compact and inform the response to future crises, Project Match in Jordan is testing a set of new innovations for matching employers and job seekers.

Match consists of two core activities:

1. ###### A mobile network of entrepreneurial employment service officers
2. ###### An algorithm that enables the IRC to optimally match jobs and job seekers

These core services are supported by a set of complementary and experimental activities, including behavioral nudges (such as sharing testimonials and providing job search planning tools), and financial support aimed at mitigating the material constraints refugees face in accessing and retaining employment.
