Available funding is not enough to meet the world’s vast needs for aid. When crises strike or intensify, humanitarian actors often spend their time mobilizing funding rather than directly responding to those in need. This means humanitarian response is often not just too little, but too late.

Airbel is working with United Kingdom’s Department for International Development’s Centre for Global Disaster Protection to assess the potential to use risk-based financing approaches to respond to refugee influxes. This work has identified five fundamental challenges in humanitarian financing, and developed a number of potential risk-based financing solutions to address those challenges, including catastrophe bonds, insurance instruments, and others.
