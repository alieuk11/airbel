[Needs background] There are over 25 million refugees, but the international response has not been able to keep up…

Airbel is exploring a new financing model for refugee resettlement. This new model would consist of a fund that would cover the initial costs of resettling refugees, framing refugee resettlement as an investment opportunity as refugees become working members of the economy. The upfront costs of relocation is currently a barrier to accepting higher volumes of refugees and better quality of resettlement. This global model of resettlement financing would mitigate the barriers and benefit refugees, host countries, and funders.

Resettlement Finance is part of a larger enterprise made up of various components, including data driven algorithms to assist in resettlement location and capitalizing on IRC’s massive volunteer network. All components aiming to create a new innovative model for refugee resettlement that is sustainable, will positively change the experience of both refugees and host countries and ultimately increase the volume of refugee resettlement globally.
