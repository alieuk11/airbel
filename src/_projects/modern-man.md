Humanitarian disasters leave affected populations with severe post-conflict trauma resulting in mental health issues, high rates of poverty and reinforced gender inequality. Under these circumstances, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) becomes systemic and pervasive.

Modern Man is a mobile messaging campaign that facilitates dialogue among men to prevent intimate partner violence. It presents an aspirational identity and behaviors that promote respectful and healthy relationships.

Harnessing the power of communication technology like SMS and WhatsApp, Modern Man provides bite-size, engaging content that challenges harmful gender norms that have been shown to lead to violence—and teaches men the importance of sexual consent. Informed by behavioral science insights, Modern Man presents multiple identities that participants can relate to, each of which emphasize the importance of respectful and healthy relationships.
