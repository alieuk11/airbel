  The Real Man Challenge is a mobile messaging campaign that engages men with an
  aspirational and positive masculine identity to prevent intimate partner
  violence. It sends WhatsApp messages to men who have opted in to practice
  positive behaviors with their partners.

      The aim is to use commonly-available mobile platforms, such as WhatsApp,
      to deliver content on healthy masculinity to 200 men in Peru and conduct a
      rigorous evaluation to measure the impact on changes of attitudes and
      behaviors associated with violence against women. The evaluation will be
      complete by the end of 2021.

      A total of 60 men were recruited from various bars, Facebook, WhatsApp
      groups and sports lounges. Our findings from the pilot include:


      * When men opened up, it created a domino effect of honest conversation in
      a safe space.

      * Using real examples or even celebrity news to discuss relevant topics is
      more engaging than open ended questions.

      * Everyone can connect and give their opinions.

      * Men were eager to hear from experts, and wanted more content from them

      * Men added 30 - 40% of the content themselves through conversational
      back-and-forth about topics we gave them or shared examples from their own
      lives - which almost always resulted in more conversation.

      * When men carried the conversation on their own without prompts, the most
      in depth conversation occurred - one result of this was each group
      condemning violence on their own

      * Men said that conversation around culture versus the RMC view pointed
      out where they had bought into negative beliefs or behaviors.&nbsp;

      Improvements and updates in the program design since the first pilot of
      Real Man Challenge include:&nbsp;


      * We developed a moderator training and Safety Monitor Guide so our
      monitor understood the process and goals behind our challenge, as well as
      the safety concerns they were looking to tackle.

      * We invited a sex and violence expert to help our moderators in real time
      when issues came up in their chats.

      * We edited our content to elicit more interaction - asking more
      questions, and including more opportunities for back and forth
      conversation, sharing and storytelling.

      * We included more direct content around taboo subjects, tackling sex,
      anger and other issues more head on, and including short audio messages
      from experts around finance, sex and communication to share with our
      groups.

      * Men in past conversations were hesitant to interact honestly because
      they didn’t know each other - we looked to establish authenticity and
      openness early on through creating a safe space, and calling out quick
      wins

      * SMS challenges were delivered to 596 men over 30 days. The recruitment
      experience resulted in exceptionally high levels of engagement for a
      simple SMS program: 55% of participants completed at least one challenge
      with 38% of men completing at least 5 challenges.&nbsp;

      * The program was evaluated using a small cluster randomized trial of 391
      men and their female partners in 16 communities. Results on violence
      outcomes were inconclusive as funding and design challenges limited power
      to detect anything but large effects; however, there were **significant**
      **reductions in women’s attitudes justifying violence** (38% reduction
      relative to control mean or 0.3 control standard deviations) as well as
      **improvements in men’s ability to self-regulate** (0.2 control standard
      deviations). Encouragingly, effects were stronger among the subset of men
      who engaged with the program more frequently.

      Using preliminary findings from Liberia, we revamp messaging and refine
      the prototype to develop a new iteration of the Modern Man Challenge that
      shifts focus from individuals to group messaging. SMS messages developed
      for Modern Man are adapted for [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) to
      support social interaction and group accountability, and the Modern Man
      Challenge is rebranded as the Real Man Challenge.&nbsp;

      Airbel partners with the Behavioral Insights Team to develop SMS messages
      that will be sent throughout the 30-day challenge. Designed to be both fun
      and thought-provoking, these messages cover sexual consent, anger
      management, financial planning, and household responsibilities.

Globally, [35% of women worldwide](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women) have experienced either physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner. Humanitarian disasters leave affected populations with severe post-conflict trauma resulting in mental health issues, high rates of poverty and reinforced gender inequality. Under these circumstances, intimate partner violence–or violence caused by a current or former partner or spouse–becomes systemic and pervasive.

Most research studies on intimate partner violence (IPV) have addressed ways to respond to violence and to support survivors AFTER violence has already occured; fewer focus on prevention, which is key to reducing and maintaining low levels of violence.&nbsp; Building on the [recent communications boom](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/11/08/in-much-of-sub-saharan-africa-mobile-phones-are-more-common-than-access-to-electricity) in sub-saharan Africa, as well as a global shift in dialogue about masculinity and a [positive trend towards gender equality](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/22/how-people-around-the-world-view-gender-equality-in-their-countries/), the IRC’s Airbel Impact Lab and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) teamed up to create a virtual, low-cost intervention that promotes healthy masculinities and reduces men&acute;s use of violence against women: The Real Man Challenge.

The Real Man Challenge (RMC) is a 30 day Whatsapp challenge that gives groups of men exclusive access to easy-to-try tips for better communication, better sex, better finances and a better home life. By harnessing the power of communication technology like SMS and WhatsApp, the Real Man Challenge can provide bite-size, engaging content on a daily basis that challenges harmful gender norms that have been shown to lead to violence. The challenge prompts men to practice behaviorally-informed skills that can increase communication, understanding, the importance of sexual consent, shared decision making, and emotional regulation. Real Man Challenge presents multiple identities that participants can relate to, each aligning to one or more of the skills mentioned and emphasizes the importance of respectful and healthy relationships.

&nbsp;

## How does it work?

The Real Man Challenge (RMC), is a digital challenge-based program delivered by a trusted male host from the community to a group of 10-15 men from his personal network through WhatsApp. Over the course of 30 days, the host shares daily behavioral and skill-building challenges on relationships and household life with the aim of both improving relationship dynamics and reducing violence. Many of the challenges also involve group members’ romantic partners. In addition, the hosts share and moderate group discussions on relevant current events to spur new thinking on gender roles.

During the 30-day-challenge, men will gain useful tools, a support network of men they can turn to, and easy to apply tips, giving them a clear path to positive results at home. Each host shares 2-3 messages every day with his group, as well as open-ended questions and multimedia content to promote further engagement. The WhatsApp intervention goes beyond sharing information by engaging groups of male peers in behavioral challenges and conversations on harmful gender norms that have been shown to lead to violence.

&nbsp;

## Our vision

The strategies and methods developed by the Real Man Challenge incorporate human-centered design, field-wide “best practices,” and research on effective behavior change across a range of outcomes. Through a series of iterative prototyping and programmatic tests, these concepts will be tailored to fit the Latin American context and encourage participation. While this virtual approach to producing behavioral change is well-suited for countries in which the COVID-19 pandemic requires strict measures of social distancing, it is also extremely relevant to a post-COVID world. This project will develop a model that can reach large numbers of men at a modest cost.
