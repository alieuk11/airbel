  Over 16 million children under the age of 3 are afflicted by severe acute
  malnutrition. To pinpoint the most impactful prevention methods, Sprout is
  experimenting with 3 distinct approaches, which include improving the storage
  practices of crops, a wide range of behavior-change interventions, and cash
  transfers.

      How likely we will meet our goal of treating 6 M children for SAM per

      * Conducted expert interviews and desk reviews to understand the potential
      for impact on SAM treatment and cost at scale of innovations in SAM
      prevention being spearheaded by members of the No Wasted Lives Coalition

      * Developed a model to analyze interactions between innovations under
      various scenarios with input from nutrition experts (users can manipulate
      the model to change assumptions as they like)

Over 16 million children under the age of 3 are afflicted by severe acute malnutrition, a condition that significantly increases their chance of dying. Current prevention efforts range from breastfeeding exclusively to multi-pronged approaches that include a dizzying number of interventions like home gardens, cash transfers, and feeding practices all together - but none have proven to be effective and scalable prevention methods.

To pinpoint the most impactful methods, Sprout is experimenting with 3 distinct approaches, which include improving the storage practices of crops, a wide range of behavior-change interventions, and cash transfers.
