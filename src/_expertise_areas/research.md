  The lack of evidence and data in crisis-affected contexts often leaves
  humanitarians working in the dark. We conduct rigorous research to understand
  the problem, test impact, improve implementation, and get better at how we
  measure these. We use a range of methods from randomized controlled trials to
  qualitative interviews and observation, matching our methods to the driving
  question.
