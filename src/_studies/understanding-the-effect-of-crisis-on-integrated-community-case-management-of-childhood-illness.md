This study used mixed methods to assess the effect of crisis on integrated community case management of childhood illness in South Sudan. Specifically, the research aimed to assess the ability of integrated community case management (iCCM) programs in South Sudan to continue providing services during emergencies, and document past and current bottlenecks in iCCM program implementation in South Sudan prior to and during emergencies. The case study found that some displaced CHWs continued to provide treatment in communities they were displaced to, if they were able to take supplies with them.&nbsp;

Despite no formal community mobilization effort, CHWs had drugs spread throughout displaced communities, with caregivers subsequently seeking care. Caregivers preferred receiving care from CHWs, particularly with the alternative being risking an insecure journey to health facilities. Based on our findings, the IRCâ€™s Emergency Health Team, Primary Health Care Team, and the Health Research Team are collaborating to develop a protocol for iCCM programs during acute emergency onset, and are actively seeking opportunities to pilot and evaluate the protocol.
