This study used a mixed-methods approach to explore how Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon perceive socio-economic vulnerability, selection processes for cash assistance, and coping strategies. The study found that the community (Syrian refugees) perceived socio-economic vulnerability as a dynamic construct, to which several variables contribute, including household size, household composition, shelter type and condition, debt, education, gender of the head of the household, labor skills, and household members with special needs. The community perceived that some households in high need (due to absence of a bread winner, low or no income, and high number of children) were not receiving cash assistance, while households in less need (due to a steady income) did receive cash assistance. Additionally, the participants perceived existing targeting methodology as random, but participants still reported targeting criteria in line with the actual targeting criteria used, such as the gender of the head of household. The study also found that borrowing money or food and delaying rent are two of the most common coping strategies refugees employ when under limited resources.
