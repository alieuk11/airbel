Through a population-based survey, the IRC will establish the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, barriers to accessing care, and the proportion of cases not under care. With this and data from a systems dynamics analysis and qualitative research with stakeholders, the study will identify pathways for community health worker service provision, technical gaps, and areas of adaptation. This re-designed CHW strategy will then be implemented and tested, including a cost-efficiency analysis. The study is in the beginning stages, and full results are expected in 2021.
