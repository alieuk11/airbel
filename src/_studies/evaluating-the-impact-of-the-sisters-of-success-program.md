The&nbsp; Sisters&nbsp; of Success&nbsp; program is designed&nbsp; to support girls’ transition into adolescence and adulthood and takes place in Monrovia, Liberia. The program recruits and matches individual girls aged 12-15 with mentors.&nbsp; Sisters of Success mentors and mentees then meet 30 times during the course of 18 months. The impact of the program is being evaluated using the randomized control trial methodology.

The program’s goals are for girls to adopt healthy behaviors; build confidence and self-esteem; increase social capital through peer groups; build and practice problem solving skills; develop communication and leadership skills and healthy peer-relationships; learn and practice their rights; begin to develop savings and financial literacy habits; increase their community participation and involvement; and work towards their own personal development goals. Longer-term impact objectives also include increasing secondary school completion rates;&nbsp; reducing teenage pregnancy; improving girls’ voices within their households; girls’ financial decision-making; girls’ social and emotional well-being; and girls’ becoming agents of change and contributors within their peer groups and communities. Data was collected during the baseline from 2,884 girls (half in treatment group, half in the control group) and one guardian for each girl. The endline survey was conducted between December 2015 and October 2016. The final findings are expected to be available in 2019.
