The RISE for Nutrition study is a follow-on study to the&nbsp;[IRCâ€™s work in South Sudan](https://tall-salute.cloudvent.net/studies/effectiveness-of-a-simplified-protocol-for-community-health-workers-to-treat-severe-acute-malnutrition-sam-in-an-emergency-prone-setting/). The RISE study will build on this evidence by positioning the IRC to lead a coalition of other implementing agencies who will operationally test the integration of treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition with their own integrated community case management programs, share experiences, and consider necessary revisions to bring the protocol and toolkit to scale. The IRC will provide technical support to four coalition members to implement four pilot studies in three countries:

* Kenya: Action Against Hunger and Save the Children
* Malawi: Concern Worldwide
* Nigeria: Malaria Consortium

The Malawi and Nigeria pilots are complete and results will be available in end of 2019. Kenya pilots are complete, and the Kenya pilots are in progress as of 2019.
