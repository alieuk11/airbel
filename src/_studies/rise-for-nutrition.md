  The RISE study will build on this evidence by positioning the IRC to lead a
  coalition of other implementing agencies who will operationally test the
  integration of treatment of uncomplicated SAM (severe acute malnutrition) with
  their own ICCM (integrated community case management) programs, share
  experiences, and consider necessary revisions to bring the protocol and
  toolkit to scale.

The RISE for Nutrition study is a follow-on study to IRCâ€™s work in South Sudan listed on page 18. The RISE study will build on this evidence by positioning the IRC to lead a coalition of other implementing agencies who will operationally test the integration of treatment of uncomplicated SAM (severe acute malnutrition) with their own ICCM (integrated community case management) programs, share experiences, and consider necessary revisions to bring the protocol and toolkit to scale. IRC will provide technical support to 4 coalition members to implement 4 pilot studies in 3 countries: Kenya (Action Against Hunger, Save the Children), Malawi (Concern Worldwide), and Nigeria (Malaria Consortium). The Malawi and Nigeria pilots are complete and results will be available in end of 2019. Kenya pilots are complete, and the Kenya pilots are in progress as of 2019.
