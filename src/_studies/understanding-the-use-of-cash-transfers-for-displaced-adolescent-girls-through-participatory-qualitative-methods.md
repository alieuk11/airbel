Despite a growing use of cash transfers, there is limited evidence of the impact of unconditional cash transfers in post-conflict settings, particularly in relation to prevention of violence against adolescent girls. The purpose if this study is to implement a continuous quality improvement research approach to 1) understand the use and perceived impact of cash transfers for&nbsp; girls in acute emergencies, as part of the COMPASS program; and 2) to pilot different qualitative, participatory methodologies with girls (aged 15-19 years) to advance understanding of which methods resonate in this age group. Specific research questions include: what are the challenges girls face in humanitarian settings, specifically related&nbsp; to the intersections of violence and economic wellbeing? How should cash transfer programming and theories of change be adapted to girls aged 15â€“19 years in this context? At the end of the cash delivery program, what did the girls perceive as the impact of cash transfers? Approximately 50 girls residing in three IDP camps in North Kivu have taken part in the qualitative continuous quality improvement model research.
