### **About ERICC**

**Education Research in Conflict and Protracted Crisis (ERICC)** is a three-year Education in Emergencies (EiE) research programme funded by the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Countries in focus include Bangladesh (Cox’s Bazar), Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria, and the programme is comprised of four main components:

1) Research on the most effective approaches to education in conflict and protracted crisis,

2) In-Country Operational Support

3) Promoting research uptake across FCDO and the international community, and

4) Knowledge Systems Strengthening

**The ERICC consortium and approach to research**

Leading ERICC components 1 & 2, and coordinating closely with leads for components 3 & 4, is the **ERICC Research Programme Consortium (RPC)**, a global research and learning partnership that strives to transform education policy and practice in conflict and protracted crisis around the world — ultimately to help improve holistic outcomes for children — through building a global hub for rigorous, context-relevant and actionable evidence base.&nbsp;

ERICC RPC seeks to identify the most effective approaches for improving access, quality, and continuity of education to support sustainable and coherent education systems and holistic learning and development of children in conflict and crisis. ERICC aims to bridge research, practice, and policy with accessible and actionable knowledge, at local, national, regional and global levels, through co-construction of research and collaborative partnerships.

The ERICC RPC is led by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), and expert partners include Centre for Lebanese Studies, Common Heritage Foundation, Forcier Consulting, ODI, Osman Consulting, and Queen Rania Foundation. During ERICC’s inception period, NYU-TIES provided research leadership, developed the original [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/a-conceptual-framework-for-education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc/) and contributed to early research agenda development.&nbsp;

**ERICC RPC is committed to four primary principles for conducting rigorous research:**

* Having developed and using [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/a-conceptual-framework-for-education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc/) to conduct systematic evidence reviews, evidence building and evidence based decision-making
* Developing contextual understandings of the Political Economy of Education of different conflict and crises settings
* A co-constructive approach to building research agendas through stakeholder engagement from the start for evidence use and evidence uptake
* Applying a research methods framework to build evidence in a systematic and rigorous way

**ERICC publications**

At the end if ERICC’s inception year the RPC published the[ERICC Inception Report](https://rescue.app.box.com/s/wfok2frnel8mbwf5cmiaulyjec3wrrvj) in March 2023. The report provides an overview of the consortium, the ERICC theory of change, the [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/a-conceptual-framework-for-education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc/), process for developing country research agendas and more. You can also read the consortium’s conceptual framework developed by NYU Global TIES for Children during the Inception Period here, and interact with the [ERICC Conceptual Framework - interactive version](https://view.genial.ly/635c02d38a3dbf0019b0111d/interactive-content-ericc-icf-or-published).&nbsp;
