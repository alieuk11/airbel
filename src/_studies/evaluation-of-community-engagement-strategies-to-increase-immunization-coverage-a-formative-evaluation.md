This project supported a multi-pronged approach to improve the utilization of maternal-child health services in a timely manner using a strategy that includes a color-coded health calendar and defaulter tracing tool in Assosa and Bambassy woredas (districts) of the Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State (BGRS). The IRC, in partnership with London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, conducted a formative evaluation to document the project’s integration in the health extension program (HEP), evaluate community co-management with health facilities and offices and utilization and acceptability of project tools, and examine the project’s contribution to improving routine immunization system performance. Findings suggest that the ‘Fifth Child’ program contributed to enhancing immunization performance in two districts of BGRS. Hence, it is vital that health policy makers and service managers, who are responsible for the HEP at regional and national level, explore with IRC how the project can be scaled up sustainably.
