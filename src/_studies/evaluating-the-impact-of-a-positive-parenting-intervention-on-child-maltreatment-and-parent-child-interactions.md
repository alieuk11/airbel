The lasting and detrimental consequences of physical, verbal, and sexual abuse endured by young children are clear, and children in post-conflict settings are often at elevated risk. As parents are often perpetrators of child&nbsp; maltreatment, interventions at the parent and family levels allow the important opportunity to decrease negative or abusive behavior. The IRC and researchers at Duke University developed a positive parenting intervention in Liberia called “Parents Make the Difference” (PMD). This 10-session&nbsp; intervention is designed to help parents and guardians of young children learn and practice alternatives to harsh punishment; develop more nurturing, warm relationships with their children; and to actively participate in promoting their child’s positive emotional and pre-academic skills development.

This&nbsp; study used&nbsp; a parallel randomized&nbsp; superiority trial design&nbsp; with equal allocation to three&nbsp; study arms to estimate the impact&nbsp; of the PMD program on parent/guardian&nbsp; and child outcomes. Parents were randomly assigned to either the group parenting program (PMD) alone or the group parenting program plus home visits (PMD+). The waitlist control&nbsp; arm was offered the group parenting program (without home visits) after the 12-month post-intervention survey round was completed.&nbsp;

Follow-up surveys were conducted with participants in all study arms at 3-months and 12 months post-intervention. This&nbsp; study found that PMD reduced child maltreatment, as measured by caregivers’ discipline preferences, and &nbsp; improved parent-child interactions 3-months after the intervention concluded. However, one year after the intervention, we no longer see differences between the intervention&nbsp; and control groups on our primary outcomes of harsh discipline or parent-child interactions. This suggests that we are not seeing continual growth in parenting skills over time post-intervention. We observed clinically meaningful reductions in parent depression, and found some support for improved attitudes about discipline practices at 3-months post-intervention. Couples’ relationships also appear to have improved&nbsp; as a result of the intervention, but the estimates carry more uncertainly because only a subset of the sample was married or in a union (i.e., we have fewer data points to estimate the effect). At the child level, we have some evidence for small improvements in perceived child&nbsp;

behavior&nbsp; problems as&nbsp; assessed by parents’&nbsp; levels of anger related&nbsp; to specific problem behaviors.

Results&nbsp; suggest that&nbsp; home visits did&nbsp; not uniquely impact&nbsp; any of the study’s primary outcomes. Although, it is notable that children of families receiving&nbsp; home visits experienced benefits in academic readiness. However, as conducting home visits&nbsp; is incredibly time and resource-intensive, the inclusion of home visits does not appear critical and is very unlikely to be cost effective.

Importantly,&nbsp; we do have limited&nbsp; evidence of longer lasting&nbsp; program impacts on parents of&nbsp; children in the sample with the&nbsp; highest levels of behavior problems&nbsp; at baseline. These results suggest that&nbsp; children and families who need the intervention&nbsp; the most receive the most benefit. If this is the case, targeting children and caregivers with existing problems may increase the positive impact of PMD and, ultimately, cost effectiveness.
