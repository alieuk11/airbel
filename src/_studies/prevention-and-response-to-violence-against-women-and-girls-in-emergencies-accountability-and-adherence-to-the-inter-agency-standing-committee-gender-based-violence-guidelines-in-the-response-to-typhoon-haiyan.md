This study, conducted as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls research program, used the 2005 IASC GBV Guidelines as a tool to understand how the humanitarian sector met the needs of women and girls in the Philippines;&nbsp; specifically looking at how prevention and mitigation of VAWG were carried out in the early phase of the emergency response and investigating the effectiveness of deploying GBV experts to assist VAWG mainstreaming in the humanitarian response. A document review was carried out along with semi-structured interviews with GBV experts and&nbsp; local and international humanitarian responders, including local womenâ€™s groups. The research found that the specific needs of women and girls and their risks to GBV were not consistently taken into account across the humanitarian response to Typhoon Haiyan. VAWG prevention and mitigation activities were considered to be a secondary&nbsp; concern rather than a life-saving priority for women, girls, and communities. &nbsp;

Additionally, &nbsp; understanding and &nbsp; interpretation of the &nbsp; IASC GBV Guidelines varied,&nbsp; resulting in inconsistent application&nbsp; and monitoring. Key barriers to implementation included lack of awareness and training, lack of accountability, and perceived lack of funding. While GBV experts strengthened&nbsp; the response, they were unable to sufficiently influence the wider humanitarian response overall.
