CDR projects are being employed in post-conflict situations around the globe. They are a mechanism to disburse development funds rapidly and support the war-to-peace transition by strengthening local communities and rendering decision-making more transparent and accountable. There is some evidence that CDR approaches improve material well-being, reinforce democratic political attitudes, and increase social cohesion in post-conflict countries. This evaluation examined whether the CDR project actually delivers the many benefits claimed, and showed that there were significant positive effects on social cohesion. Survey data suggest that the program reduced social tension, increased the inclusion of marginalized groups, and enhanced individualsâ€™ trust in community leadership.
