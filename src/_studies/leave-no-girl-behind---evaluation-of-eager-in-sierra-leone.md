The Every Adolescent Girl Empowered and Resilient (EAGER) project is a DFID-funded Girls' Education Challenge (GEC) Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) project in Sierra Leone. EAGER is implemented by the IRC in partnership with Concern Worldwide (CWW), Restless Development, and BBC Action Media in ten districts across Sierra Leone. The project duration is approximately four years running from February 2019 to January 2023. EAGER targets out-of-school (OOS) adolescent girls aged 13-17 – those who have never attended school or who have dropped out – and lack basic literacy and numeracy skills.

EAGER aims to significantly improve learning outcomes for functional literacy and numeracy as well as business and life skills through an eleven-month learning programme. Additionally, girls will receive one-on-one mentorships from selected female mentors within the community to develop individual transition plans focused on empowerment (economic, learning, household, community and personal). EAGER aims to reach a total of 32,500 adolescent girls across three cohorts in 500 communities with activities for cohort one (7,500 girls) starting in January 2020. Cohort one is the focus of the external evaluation.

### **Research questions**

The IMC evaluation team was required to develop an evaluation approach that answers the following overarching questions, with support from the EAGER Consortium Coordination Unit (CCU):

* Process – Was the project successfully designed and implemented?
* Impact – What impact did the project have on the learning and transition of marginalized girls, including girls with disabilities?&nbsp; How and why was this impact achieved?
* Effectiveness – What worked (and did not work) to increase the learning and transition of marginalized girls as defined by the project?&nbsp; What adaptations and improvements can be made to the project for cohorts 2 and 3?
* Sustainability – How sustainable were the activities funded by the GEC-LNGB and in what way? Was the project successful in leveraging additional interest and investment?

Specific questions that IMC will be required to answer using a mixed-methods evaluation approach are:

1. How do the effects of the EAGER learning project on girls’ learning and transition outcomes vary for different subgroups of girls (e.g. single vs. married, pregnant vs. not pregnant, disabled vs. non-disabled, rural vs urban, older vs younger girls, etc.)?
2. What individual (including psychometric measures), home, and community level characteristics are associated with girls’ learning and transition outcomes?
3. What implementation characteristics (e.g. attendance to interventions, community members’ engagement with radio show and community group discussions) moderate the effect of the EAGER learning project and Business training on girls’ learning and transition outcomes?
4. What are the girls’ perceptions and experiences with the interventions?
5. What are the profiles and experiences of girls that were successfully able to transition to formal education, training or (self) employment and how do they differ from girls who were unable to transition into new paths?
6. What are some of the facilitators/barriers to successful transition? Are the girls able to remain in their chosen transition pathway after the project and mentoring concludes? What obstacles remain for girls who were unable to transition?
7. What are the community attitudes and facilitators/barriers to girls’ education and employment? How do these change over the course of the project?
8. How can the project improve for future cohorts? What elements of the intervention work/do not work, and what adaptations can be made?

### **Methodology**

**Baseline**

A convergent mixed methods design informed this baseline evaluation; quantitative and qualitative data collection occurred simultaneously. The evaluation design includes a pre- and post-test assessment of a group of treatment girls and a cluster-based sampling method accounting for marginalization status and geographic diversity. Surveys and learning assessments were conducted with 2,084 beneficiary girls from 215 communities, and their caregivers or head of households for quantitative data collection. The qualitative component provides context and depth to the findings of the quantitative impact evaluation and increases validity by triangulating findings. Qualitative data collection relied on a purposeful approach across 10 communities (1 per each of the 10 implementation districts) and reached 441 individuals (247 females and 194 males, including 144 beneficiaries) via key informant interview and focus group discussions.

Tools used during the baseline evaluation were:

* Adapted Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA)
* Adapted Out of school Learning Assessment (OLA)
* Girls’ Combined Survey
* Life Skills Survey
* Head of households Survey
* Caregiver Surveys
* Key informant interviews (KIIs)
* Focus group discussions (FGDs)
* Program Data Sheet
