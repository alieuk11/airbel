EAGER&nbsp; (Every&nbsp; Adolescent&nbsp; Girl&nbsp; Empowered&nbsp; and&nbsp; Resilient)&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; 4-year&nbsp; education&nbsp; and&nbsp; empowerment&nbsp; project&nbsp; designed&nbsp; for&nbsp; out-of-school&nbsp; (OOS)&nbsp; adolescent&nbsp; girls&nbsp; ages&nbsp; 13-19 (13-17 Cohort 1, 2019-2021, and 13-19 Cohort 2, 2022)&nbsp; who&nbsp; have&nbsp; missed&nbsp; out&nbsp; on&nbsp; formal&nbsp; learning&nbsp; opportunities &nbsp; Through&nbsp; a&nbsp; consortium&nbsp; of&nbsp; four&nbsp; partners&nbsp; (the&nbsp; International&nbsp; Rescue&nbsp; Committee, Concern Worldwide, Restless Development, and BBC Media Action) operating in 10 districts of Sierra Leone, EAGER staff and community-based volunteers work together to&nbsp; deliver&nbsp; functional&nbsp; Literacy,&nbsp; Numeracy,&nbsp; Financial&nbsp; Literacy,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Life&nbsp; Skills&nbsp; sessions&nbsp; for&nbsp; girls.&nbsp; Girls attend this Learning Programme for 30 weeks in female-only Safe Spaces and Learning Centres.

All &nbsp; sessions &nbsp; are &nbsp; delivered &nbsp; by &nbsp; volunteer &nbsp; Mentors &nbsp; and &nbsp; Facilitators who were recruited from the girls’ communities and trained to lead sessions and provide ongoing support to girls. Female Mentors are the first line of contact and support for girls and are responsible for building a relationship of trust with them as they lead the Life Skills sessions. &nbsp; Facilitators lead functional Literacy, Numeracy, and Financial Literacy sessions for girls&nbsp; They are expected to encourage a growth mindset in girls and shift the disempowering narrative that OOS adolescent girls are not capable of learning&nbsp; Both Mentors and Facilitators are coached and encouraged to be allies&nbsp; and&nbsp; advocates&nbsp; for&nbsp; girls&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; community.

By the end of the Learning Programme, every girl will have completed an Empowerment Plan in which she set her own learning,&nbsp; household,&nbsp; community,&nbsp; and&nbsp; financial&nbsp; goals &nbsp; After&nbsp; graduating&nbsp; from&nbsp; EAGER,&nbsp; this&nbsp; plan&nbsp; will&nbsp; guide&nbsp; her&nbsp; through&nbsp; a&nbsp; Transition&nbsp; phase,&nbsp; where&nbsp; she&nbsp; will&nbsp; use&nbsp; the&nbsp; different&nbsp; skills&nbsp; she&nbsp; learned&nbsp; to&nbsp; work&nbsp; toward&nbsp; her&nbsp; goals &nbsp; EAGER&nbsp; graduates&nbsp; receive&nbsp; a&nbsp; conditional&nbsp; cash&nbsp; grant&nbsp; to&nbsp; pursue&nbsp; their&nbsp; financial&nbsp; goal&nbsp; and&nbsp; practice&nbsp; the&nbsp; skills&nbsp; they&nbsp; learned&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; Financial&nbsp; Literacy&nbsp; sessions

To strengthen the support systems around girls, EAGER teams lead structured Community Dialogues with girls’ caregivers and with influential community member. Participants are encouraged to wrap up each dialogue by identifying concrete actions they can take to address the problems girls are facing, and agreed plans are documented for accountability. To &nbsp; build &nbsp; support &nbsp; for &nbsp; girls &nbsp; across &nbsp; the &nbsp; wider &nbsp; population, EAGER produces weekly girl-centred radio programmes and broadcasts them on national and local radio stations.

Through a cycle of two successive cohorts of girls, EAGER has worked directly with 28,000 OOS adolescent girls across Sierra&nbsp; Leone &nbsp; In&nbsp; line&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; vision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Girls’&nbsp; Education&nbsp; Challenge&nbsp; (GEC)&nbsp; Leave&nbsp; No&nbsp; Girl&nbsp; Behind&nbsp; (LNGB)&nbsp; approach,&nbsp; the&nbsp; project&nbsp; set&nbsp; out&nbsp; to&nbsp; reach&nbsp; some&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; most&nbsp; marginalised&nbsp; adolescent girls in Sierra Leone&nbsp; This has meant working in remote areas where literacy levels are generally lower, as the probability of completing primary education is 56% for rural children, compared to 89% for urban children.

The&nbsp; EAGER&nbsp; Baseline&nbsp; Evaluation&nbsp; confirmed&nbsp; that&nbsp; 45%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; girls&nbsp; enrolled&nbsp; had&nbsp; never&nbsp; attended&nbsp; school,&nbsp; and&nbsp; 45%&nbsp; had&nbsp; dropped&nbsp; out&nbsp; early&nbsp; without&nbsp; learning&nbsp; functional&nbsp; reading&nbsp; and&nbsp; writing &nbsp; Many&nbsp; were&nbsp; already&nbsp; married&nbsp; (44%)&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; already&nbsp; had the responsibilities of caring for their own children (58%).&nbsp; Heavy&nbsp; chore&nbsp; burdens&nbsp; were&nbsp; noted&nbsp; to&nbsp; isolate&nbsp; girls&nbsp; from&nbsp; their&nbsp; peers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; access&nbsp; to&nbsp; information,&nbsp; resources,&nbsp; services,&nbsp; and&nbsp; opportunities was limited by literacy and financial constraints as well as the gender norms that limit girls’ self-determination in &nbsp;their&nbsp; homes&nbsp; and&nbsp; communities.

The project was designed to address these multiple barriers to participation and learning, and to create accessible opportunities &nbsp; and &nbsp; supportive &nbsp; spaces &nbsp; for &nbsp; girls &nbsp; to &nbsp; build &nbsp; practical and empowering skills.&nbsp; These&nbsp; skills&nbsp; were&nbsp; tailored&nbsp; to the girls’ context and daily lives so they could be practiced and&nbsp; used&nbsp; to&nbsp; create&nbsp; positive&nbsp; changes&nbsp; for&nbsp; themselves,&nbsp; their&nbsp; families,&nbsp; and&nbsp; communities &nbsp; Following&nbsp; a&nbsp; socio-ecological&nbsp; model,&nbsp; the&nbsp; project&nbsp; aims&nbsp; to&nbsp; empower&nbsp; OOS&nbsp; adolescent&nbsp; girls&nbsp; on&nbsp; a&nbsp; personal&nbsp; level&nbsp; while&nbsp; strengthening&nbsp; the&nbsp; support&nbsp; systems&nbsp; around&nbsp; them&nbsp; through&nbsp; increased&nbsp; awareness&nbsp; and&nbsp; opportunities&nbsp; for&nbsp; collective&nbsp; action.
