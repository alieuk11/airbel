In collaboration with IRC’s governance unit, this project is testing a participatory systems strengthening approach called “Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation.” It is founded on four principles:

1. Focusing on specific problems as prioritized by local actors;
2. Fostering active, ongoing experimental iterations to turn ideas into solutions;
3. Establishing an “authorizing environment” for decision-making that encourages experimentation and “positive deviance”; and
4. Engaging broad sets of agents to ensure that reforms are viable, legitimate, and relevant.&nbsp;

This will be tested in a subset of health facilities in Myanmar to determine whether we observe increases in accountability and quality of care.
