In collaboration with IRC’s Governance Unit, this project is testing a participatory systems strengthening approach called “Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation,” founded on four principles:

1. focusing on specific problems as prioritized by local actors;
2. fostering active, ongoing experimental iterations to turn ideas into solutions;
3. establishing an “authorizing environment” for decision-making that encourages experimentation and “positive deviance”; and
4. engaging broad sets of agents to ensure that reforms are viable, legitimate, and relevant.&nbsp;

This will be tested in a subset of health facilities in Myanmar to determine whether we observe increases in accountability and quality of care.
