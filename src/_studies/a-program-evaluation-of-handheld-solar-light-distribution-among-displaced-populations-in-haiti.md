Women and girls are disproportionately affected by GBV in humanitarian and&nbsp; displacement settings, as they are often separated from families,and&nbsp; living in contexts in which rule of law, safety, and security are severely &nbsp; compromised. Adequate lighting in communal areas or lighting for individual&nbsp; use is currently recommended in the Guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian&nbsp; Settings, and while previous evaluations on the use of handheld and/or street lights have&nbsp; been conducted in development and humanitarian settings, these evaluations recommended further work to&nbsp; understand if and how women use individual handheld lights. This pre- and post-test mixed methods evaluation&nbsp; documented the&nbsp; use and benefits&nbsp; of handheld solar lights&nbsp; among females aged 14 and older to mitigate the risks for violence in IDP camps and to improve their sense of safety in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (n=754).&nbsp; Evaluation results were used to improve the IRCs handheld solar light program and inform decisions about how to sustain and improve the use of handheld solar lights in that population.
