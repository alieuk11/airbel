The&nbsp; IRC has&nbsp; developed the&nbsp; Engaging Men in&nbsp; Accountable Practice&nbsp; initiative, which aims to engage men as agents of change while being accountable to women’s voices in their communities to prevent violence against&nbsp; women and girls (VAWG). The IRC undertook a rigorous randomized controlled trial of the initiative across 30 communities in North and South Kivu, DRC. The study was a two-armed, pair-matched, cluster &nbsp; randomized controlled trial in which approximately 1,500 men and their female partners were interviewed as part of the study examining the impact of the Engaging Men in Accountable Practice initiative on potential changes in intimate partner violence perpetration and secondary outcomes such as gender norms. Analyses of results is currently ongoing and dissemination is expected in 2019.
