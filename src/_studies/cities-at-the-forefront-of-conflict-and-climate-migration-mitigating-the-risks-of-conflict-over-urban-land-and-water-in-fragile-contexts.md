  Cities at the forefront of conflict and climate migration: Mitigating the
  risks of conflict over urban land and water in fragile contexts
featured: false
evergreen: false
focuses:
  - empowerment
description: >
  Forced migration and displacement are re-shaping cities and countries across
  the globe. More people are displaced by conflict and natural disaster today
  than at any point in history and the percentage of world population displaced
  is increasing. Climate change is widely recognized as a contributing and
  exacerbating factor in migration and in conflict. When people flee, in most
  instances it is not across borders but rather to closest cities. While much
  climate change research is focused on the push-factors for displacement, less
  is known on locations of settlement and the solutions to mitigate negative
  impacts and harness positive impacts of migration. Cities are at the forefront
  of responding to climate migration, yet many are ill-prepared and
  under-researched to manage growing urban populations. 


  This study aimed to contribute to improving inclusive and equitable natural
  resource management in fragile and conflict-affected urban and peri-urban
  contexts affected by internal migration through enhancing knowledge of how
  displacement affects the governance of natural resources in these areas and
  identification of promising approaches in addressing problems that may arise.
  A literature review was completed along with a participatory comparative case
  study research in Maiduguri, Nigeria and Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo
  (DRC).
