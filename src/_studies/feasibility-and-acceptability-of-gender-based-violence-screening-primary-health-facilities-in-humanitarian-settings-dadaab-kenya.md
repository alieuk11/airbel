Screening&nbsp; for GBV has&nbsp; become a topic&nbsp; of debate in humanitarian&nbsp; programming over the past few&nbsp; years as research has largely been&nbsp; limited to studies in developed countries.&nbsp; To address this, IRC has worked since 2011&nbsp; on the piloting, implementation, and evaluation&nbsp; of the ASIST-GBV, a GBV screening tool developed&nbsp; by Johns Hopkins University specifically for use in&nbsp; humanitarian settings. Findings from the evaluation indicate&nbsp; that, with the appropriate measures taken and prerequisites met, GBV screening by health providers has the potential to&nbsp; 1) create a confidential environment where survivors can speak openly about their experiences with GBV, 2) ensure&nbsp; competent care and referrals based on individual needs and wishes of survivors, and 3) increase community awareness about GBV&nbsp; issues, thereby reducing stigma and improving attitudes.
