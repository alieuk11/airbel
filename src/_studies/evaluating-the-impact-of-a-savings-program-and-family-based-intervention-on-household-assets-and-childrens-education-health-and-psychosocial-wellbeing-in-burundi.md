As one of the first randomized controlled trials on the impact of VSLAs, the results from the New Generation project provide important evidence that&nbsp; VSLAs combined with entrepreneurship and financial literacy education can improve the economic outcomes of poor households. Limited statistical&nbsp; power prevents us from being able to confidently report on the impact of the economic intervention alone on child protection and wellbeing outcomes. However, results suggest that while the&nbsp; economic intervention improved household income and reduced family problems, it did not impact overall family functioning, reduce harsh discipline practices, or improve positive discipline, child&nbsp; wellbeing or mental health. The evaluation did find that the family-based discussion sessions significantly reduced harsh physical and verbal discipline by caregivers in the home. However, although&nbsp; children reported positive impact on their overall wellbeing, survey data from caregivers did not demonstrate that the discussion sessions had a significant impact on children’s mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The&nbsp; results from this evaluation are an important contribution to a growing body of evidence related to economic strengthening and child protection in low-income and conflict-affected settings but findings reveal that there is still&nbsp; much learning to be done to determine which interventions are most needed and result in the greatest improvements to child protection and wellbeing outcomes.&nbsp;
