Menstrual hygiene management is a truly cross-sectoral challenge that affects women and girlsâ€™ health, protection, and wellbeing. There is a dearth of guidance for humanitarian actors on how to meet menstrual hygiene management needs across sectors in a comprehensive manner during emergencies. The objectives of the study are to develop and describe the implementation of a coordinated response integrating menstrual hygiene management, and to tie the components of the response to measurable outcomes for programming in acute emergencies. A cross-sectoral research team developed a toolkit and defined health and social outcomes for the evaluation of integrated responses.
