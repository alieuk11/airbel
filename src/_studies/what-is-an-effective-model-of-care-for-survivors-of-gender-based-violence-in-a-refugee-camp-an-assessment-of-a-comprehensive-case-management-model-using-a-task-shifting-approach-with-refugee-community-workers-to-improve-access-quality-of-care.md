The aim of this study, as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls research program, was to understand how the IRC/CARE gender-based violence (GBV) response model of individual comprehensive case management provision with expanded care through task shifting can influence access, quality, and impact on health and safety outcomes among refugee women in the Dada refugee camps. This research project used a prospective cohort design (multiple data collection points, no randomization or control group) with a qualitative evaluation component in order to systematically understand and document the processes of individual comprehensive case management with a task shifting model among GBV survivors accessing IRC and CARE GBV programming. Survivors were assessed at four time points: intake for IRC/CARE GBV services, during the case management process, at the close of their case file, and at a three month follow-up. Refugee community workers were also surveyed to assess perceptions on work tasks, work satisfaction, and influence on survivorsâ€™ outcomes.

Key findings include:

* Refugee community workers face a number of specific risks, challenges, opportunities, and rewards
* Survivors reported the GBV case management model with task sharing was satisfactory.
* Contextual factors play an influential role on GBV case management and referrals.
* Research on GBV case management services is complex
