The&nbsp; aim of&nbsp; this study, as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls research program,&nbsp; was to understand how the IRC/CARE gender-based violence (GBV) response model of individual &nbsp; comprehensive case management provision with expanded care through task shifting can influence access,&nbsp; quality, and impact on health and safety outcomes among refugee women in the Dada refugee camps. This&nbsp; research project used a prospective cohort design (multiple data collection points, no randomization or control &nbsp; group) with a qualitative evaluation component in order to systematically understand and document the processes of&nbsp; individual comprehensive case management with a task shifting model among GBV survivors accessing IRC and CARE GBV programming.&nbsp; Survivors were assessed at four time points: intake for IRC/CARE GBV services, during the case management process, at the close of&nbsp; their case file, and at a three month follow-up. Refugee community workers were also surveyed to assess perceptions on work tasks, work satisfaction, and influence on survivorsâ€™ outcomes.

Key findings include:

* Refugee community workers face a number of specific risks, challenges, opportunities, and rewards.
* Survivors reported the GBV case management model with task sharing was satisfactory.
* Contextual factors play an influential role on GBV case management and referrals.
* Research on GBV case management services is complex
