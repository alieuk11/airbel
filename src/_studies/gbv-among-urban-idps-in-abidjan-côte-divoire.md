Despite widespread concern regarding GBV against women in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te&nbsp; d’Ivoire as a threat to post-conflict stability and development, systematic &nbsp; data on GBV and humanitarian programmatic efforts to protect and empower&nbsp; women in conflict-affected urban settings are lacking. Through analysis of survey&nbsp; data (n=80) and qualitative research (10 focus groups), the investigative team sought&nbsp; to advance current understanding of GBV experiences and assess the feasibility and acceptability&nbsp; of socio-economic programs aimed to prevent GBV and improve economic wellbeing among urban Ivorian&nbsp; women. This work aimed to guide empirically informed programs to address GBV in urban settings. Study findings highlight the importance of recognizing the&nbsp; interplay&nbsp; between different&nbsp; forms of violence within&nbsp; intimate partner relationships.&nbsp; Additionally, programs focused on&nbsp; economic empowerment for women were shown to have the potential to increase violence against women, including economic violence, and thus need to build in elements to mitigate this risk.
