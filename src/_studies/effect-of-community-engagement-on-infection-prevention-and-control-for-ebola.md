As Uganda begins to respond to the Ebola outbreak, which has crossed their border with epidemic-affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the IRC has begun activities to strengthen surveillance at the community level, reinforce infection prevention and control measures at health facilities, and support point of entry screening.

This research seeks to assess the impact of increased community engagement on:&nbsp;

1. these preparedness activities, and
2. on the community awareness of Ebola, health care seeking behaviors, and attitudes towards health workers in health facilities.
