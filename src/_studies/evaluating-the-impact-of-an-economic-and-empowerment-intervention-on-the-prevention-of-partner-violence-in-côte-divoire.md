Building on a study conducted in Burundi, this project evaluated whether participation in a savings group and a discussion group confronting gender&nbsp; norms leads to an increase in women’s individual agency and decision-making ability, and whether those increased capacities will in turn improve their economic independence and decrease intimate partner violence in their homes. The baseline was completed in 2010, and a survey measuring the impacts of the 2010–2011 political conflict on participants in the savings groups was completed in 2011.&nbsp; The study found that pairing a dialogue group that engages couples on household gender dynamics with an economic empowerment program for women was more effective in reducing intimate partner violence in conflict-affected communities in C&ocirc;te d’Ivoire than the economic empowerment program alone.
