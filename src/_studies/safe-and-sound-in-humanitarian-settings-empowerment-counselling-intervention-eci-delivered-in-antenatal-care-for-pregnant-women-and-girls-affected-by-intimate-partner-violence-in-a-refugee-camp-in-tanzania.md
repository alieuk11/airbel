This research aims to address the feasibility and acceptability of a brief empowerment counseling intervention (ECI) among pregnant women and girls receiving antenatal care (ANC) who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), in humanitarian healthcare settings. This 3-year study will take place in two IRC-managed health posts in a refugee camp in Kigoma, Tanzania. The objectives of the study are to: 1) Adapt for use in the context of ANC in a humanitarian setting, a brief ECI to address women’s and girls’ exposure to sexual and/or physical IPV during pregnancy, by improving their mental health, self-efficacy, safety, and coping strategies; 2) Test the ECI through a rigorous pilot evaluation, determining whether the intervention is feasible/acceptable in a humanitarian setting and whether it has the potential to improve women’s self-efficacy, reduce mental distress and increase uptake of longer-term IPV services; 3) Test the feasibility of integrating such an intervention into pre-existing ANC service delivery in humanitarian settings and make recommendations for future intervention research and development, including effectively linking routine enquiry of IPV in ANC settings with support service use.

Formative research with providers and clients will inform the intervention adaptation. Mixed-methods research will then be undertaken to assess the intervention. Findings from the study will be used to produce recommendations for further research, and for healthcare providers to address GBV effectively in resource-limited ANC services in humanitarian settings.
