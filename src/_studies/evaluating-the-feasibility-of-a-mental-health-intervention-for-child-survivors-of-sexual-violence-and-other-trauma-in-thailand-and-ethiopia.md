Women &nbsp; and children &nbsp; face significantly &nbsp; increased risks of &nbsp; sexual violence during conflict and natural disaster.&nbsp; The IRC’s experience has shown that programs are typically&nbsp; designed to meet the specific needs of adult women, yet girls&nbsp; under the age of 18 often make up the majority of clients reporting to sexual assault and referral centers. GBV&nbsp; emergency responders consistently request support to better serve the needs of this particularly vulnerable population&nbsp; of clients; therefore, the IRC aimed to introduce a new evidence-based program model to increase the capacity of emergency responders to meet child survivors’&nbsp; needs more rapidly and appropriately when emergencies strike. The evaluation aimed to assess the feasibility and performance of an adapted mental health&nbsp; intervention in reducing psychological distress and increasing functioning of child survivors of sexual violence and other forms of trauma in refugee settings.&nbsp; Findings showed that following the intervention, children and their caregivers reported an average decrease in children’s internalizing or emotional problems,&nbsp; an average decrease in children’s externalizing or behavior problems, a large reduction in children’s attention, thought, and social problems, and an average increase in the children’s wellbeing.
