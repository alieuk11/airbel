Following on previous research that led to the development of a Menstrual Hygiene and Management in Emergencies toolkit, this project is being undertaken in Myanmar and Nigeria (and possibly elsewhere) to improve the technical guidance available for humanitarian responders seeking to address Menstrual Hygiene Management, including disposal, waste management and laundering needs of girls and women.
