This&nbsp; study, part of DFID’s What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls research program,&nbsp; focused on three countries, Nepal, South Sudan, and Sierra Leone, and reviewed how different&nbsp; forms and drivers of violence against women and girls (VAWG) have been addressed by national and international actors in state building and peace building processes in&nbsp; these three countries. The study sought to systematically assess and synthesize existing evidence of the impacts of state building and peace building related&nbsp; to VAWG. It considered a range of forms of VAWG, including but not limited to, conflict-related and other forms of sexual violence, intimate partner violence,&nbsp; forced/early marriage, and female genital mutilation/cutting. Where possible, the study captured information on how specific interventions within the state and&nbsp; peacebuilding process (e.g., security and justice sector reform, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration, promoting political participation and accountable governance, economic/livelihoods activities, trauma healing and psychosocial activities or community-level reconciliation/conflict resolution interventions, etc.) impacted VAWG. A conflict analysis lens was applied during data analysis to ensure that factors related to specific characteristics of conflict, which determine the impact of state- and peace-building processes on VAWG were identified. This assisted in making recommendations to improve the impact of&nbsp; state- and peace-building processes on VAWG. The results of a semi-structured survey allowed us to analyze the perceived importance and relevance of different regional and international recommendations. The study created and used a model for data triangulation to ensure confidence in the findings.

Key findings include:

* Rates of VAWG, including forms of violence not traditionally considered conflict-related, are high during and after periods of conflict and have lasting effects on the lives of women and girls. However, VAWG is often insufficiently addressed in state-building and peace-building efforts.
* VAWG and conflict can have many common causes and drivers, including patriarchy and gender discrimination, that impact peace and conflict at all levels.
* Women are frequently excluded from both peace processes and wider political participation in conflict and post-conflict settings. Institutions that work on women’s rights (government and civil society) play a significant role in efforts to eliminate VAWG and in the advancement of more peaceful societies.
* The post-conflict period provides an opportunity to advance policy and legal frameworks addressing VAWG. However, despite progress in policy and legal reform, state-run services necessary to address and reduce VAWG are insufficient in post-conflict contexts, reducing trust in and legitimacy of state service providers.
