To&nbsp; date,&nbsp; the humanitarian&nbsp; community has largely&nbsp; focused on intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment via separate and distinct interventions&nbsp; and strategies. While standalone programming can be effective, the effects of each type of programming&nbsp; can be magnified on other forms of violence in the home through a family violence approach. To fill this gap, the IRC conducted formative research in two&nbsp; countries, the DRC and Myanmar, to understand the factors that enable IPV against women and the abuse, neglect and exploitation of children and against other vulnerable&nbsp; members within the household and how they are interrelated. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Following this learning, the IRC adapted parenting and engaging men programs to better address shared drivers of violence in the home. A pre-posttest was conducted in North Kivu, DRC and significant, positive results were demonstrated in reductions in acceptance of harsh discipline, IPV, child maltreatment, and other outcomes.&nbsp; The IRC is now taking learning from this first iteration to adapt the Safe at Home approach and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in DRC to understand its causal impact on outcomes.
