In order to better understand the constraints refugee women&nbsp; face across contexts, the IRC is undertaking exploratory &nbsp; research in three different contexts (Niger, Kenya,and &nbsp; Germany) to understand the barriers and challenges displaced &nbsp; women face in entering and participating in the labor market (including&nbsp; participation in livelihoods interventions). The overall objective is to use &nbsp; the information generated through the research to design, conduct and evaluate small scale pilots in all three locations to improve&nbsp; womenâ€™s participation in livelihoods interventions and the labor market.
