DFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) is helping the world’s poorest girls improve their lives through education and supporting better ways of getting girls in school and ensuring they receive a quality education to transform their future. The IRC will implement the Every Adolescent Girl Empowered and Resilient (EAGER) learning program in Sierra Leone and Teach and Educate Adolescent-Girls with Community Help (TEACH) in Pakistan to improve the literacy, numeracy, life skills and transition outcomes of hard-to-reach girls in these two conflict and crisis-affected settings.&nbsp;

Both projects will use a pre-post, longitudinal and mixed-methods research design to identify: 1) the impact and cost-efficiency of the interventions, 2) the degree to which the interventions have a differential effect on different groups of girls (e.g., married, pregnant, disabled, orphaned or in foster care, etc.); 3) the individual, home and community characteristics that are associated with girls’ learning and transition outcomes; 4) the implementation characteristics that moderate the effect of the interventions on girls’ learning and transition outcomes, and 5) the variety of girls’ perceptions and experiences with the interventions.&nbsp;
