Family and parenting interventions in the United States and Australia show powerful effects to prevent and reduce child abuse and neglect, but few evaluations of these interventions exist outside stable, developed countries. Burmese families in Thailand face multiple stressors including displacement, lack of legal status, and difficulty finding work. The IRC currently has programs addressing many of these needs, but has also identified&nbsp; a need to support families further to protect their children. &nbsp;

The&nbsp; IRC implemented&nbsp; an evidence-based&nbsp; family intervention&nbsp; with Burmese migrant and&nbsp; displaced families in Thailand&nbsp; and conducted a randomized impact evaluation to assess family and child outcomes. The randomized controlled trial conducted to measure the impact used a sample size of 479 families in 20 communities. Results show that the intervention had a significant positive impact on parenting practices and family functioning, and mixed impact on harsh punishment and child psychological wellbeing. In general, effects were maintained six months post-intervention.
