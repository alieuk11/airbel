Mobile and remote technology-based programming may be able to address key&nbsp; gaps in service delivery for gender-based violence (GBV) in emergencies but little is known about&nbsp; the feasibility and acceptability of these methods. The guidance aims to support donors and GBV practitioners to effectively resource and design quality mobile and remote technology-based programming for GBV Service Delivery.Mixed-methods data from individual interviews and focus group discussions in Iraq, Burundi, and Myanmar was collected in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Findings&nbsp; indicate that&nbsp; mobile and remote&nbsp; GBV service delivery&nbsp; is feasible and acceptable&nbsp; with beneficiaries across all&nbsp; settings. From this, the IRC developed Guidelines for Mobile and Remote Gender-Based Violence Service Delivery.
