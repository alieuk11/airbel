A large survey of 1,200 households was conducted in March-April 2011 in several counties of South Sudan to determine the impact of the iCCM program implemented by Malaria Consortium, Save the Children, and the IRC on under-five health and mortality. The goal of the iCCM program is to provide prompt and effective iCCM of fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia (acute respiratory infections) in underserved rural areas in four countries: Mozambique, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia. The goal of the iCCM program was to reduce all-cause post-neonatal under-five mortality by 35 percent and avert up to 30,000 child deaths.
