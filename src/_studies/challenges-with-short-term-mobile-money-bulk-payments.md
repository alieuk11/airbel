The IRC conducted research in Pakistan in order to develop a better understanding of the challenges with short-term mobile money bulk payments and to understand the constraints, limitations and incentives faced by service providers and the agents on the ground. Specifically, the research had two primary objectives:

1. Identify and document barriers and challenges faced by service providers and agents when handling large scale cash-outs in Pakistan
2. Generate ideas and solutions to tackle these barriers and constraints

The information generated through this research enabled the IRC and other humanitarian organizations to better understand how to engage with service providers and what steps to take to ensure a smooth roll out of cash assistance programs when using mobile money payments for disbursements in emergencies.
