This study, conducted among Burundian refugees in Nyaragusu camp in&nbsp; Tanzania, aimed to inform public health responses to humanitarian crises, particularly with regard to psychosocial issues such as intimate partner&nbsp; violence (IPV). It included a feasibility randomized controlled trial of an integrated intervention that simultaneously targeted IPV and its&nbsp; psychosocial health consequences in a refugee camp in a low-income country. This feasibility trial examined the relevance, accessibility, and&nbsp; feasibility of the intervention procedures. Findings suggest the intervention requires further adaptation before it can be feasibly implemented across&nbsp; multiple sectors/clusters. Ownership and coordination across both the health and protection sectors proved to be a key challenge. This feasibility trial does not&nbsp; allow us to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the intervention.&nbsp;
