title: Empowerment
description: >-
  Millions of people across the world donâ€™t have control over important choices
  that affect their lives, such as where they live, how they live, and how they
  are governed. Women and girls, in particular, struggle to advocate for their
  rights and make their voices heard. These issues are worsened by crises, which
  often uproot families, tear apart communities, and weaken government systems.
