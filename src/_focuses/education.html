title: Education
description: During conflict and crisis, education protects children and sets them up for a better future. It provides a sense of hope and enables them to recover, learn and thrive. However, over 62 million children in countries affected by war remain out of school, while many others receive only a poor quality education. Despite this great need, education has received less than two percent of all humanitarian aid in recent years.
