title: Innovative Finance
description: >-
    The financing systems designed to serve conflict-affected communities are
    broke and broken, and despite years of hype, the potential of innovative
    finance for people affected by humanitarian crises remains unfulfilled; new

    finance practice seek to demonstrate how progress can be made through novel
    applications of existing financial tools to new contexts.
