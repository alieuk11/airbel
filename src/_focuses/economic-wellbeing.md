title: Economic Wellbeing
description: >-
  People caught in crisis may struggle to meet their basic needs and those of their families - such as food, water, shelter, and other basic household items like soap. Direct assistance, such as cash distribution can help people meet these needs. But opportunities to work can help people build stability and prosper. Yet, in most situations of protracted displacement, there are considerable legal, policy, and financial barriers to unlocking this potential.
