  In conflict settings, women are more susceptible to  gender-based violence and
  sexual exploitation by their partners and others. Girls are at risk of sexual
  violence and physical and emotional abuse by their partners and caregivers,
  and often face early or forced marriage. Boys are also at risk of hazardous
  child labor and also grapple with child abuse and neglect. How can we avoid
  reinforcing the effects of violence and conflict?
