  Each year, millions of people, particularly women and children, die from
  preventable causes in countries affected by violent conflict and natural
  disasters. Most of these deaths are the result of disruptions related to
  crisis: poor sanitation, shortages of food and medicine, and inadequate
  prevention. Refugees resettled in the United States can also face difficulties
  accessing proper health care.
