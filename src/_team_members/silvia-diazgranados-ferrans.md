Silvia Diazgranados Ferr&aacute;ns, MA, Ed.D is the Senior Education Researcher at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and leads IRC’s global education research agenda. At the IRC, Silvia manages a portfolio of research projects in 15 countries that aim to identify what works to improve access and learning outcomes for children in emergency settings, for whom, at what cost and under what conditions, and on developing valid and reliable tools to measure these outcomes.

Prior to joining the IRC, Silvia worked at the Harvard Graduate School of Education as the instructor of the course “Peace Education in a Comparative Perspective” and as the external evaluator of impact evaluations of education programs implemented by national and international NGOs. As a clinical and developmental psychologist, Silvia conducted clinical and research work with victims of war and prolonged captivity from the Colombian armed conflict, and supported former child soldiers from guerrilla and paramilitary groups in their process of reintegration to civil society.

Silvia holds an Ed.D in Human Development and Education and a MA in Prevention Science and Practice from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA; and BA degrees in Psychology and Philosophy from the University of Los Andes, Colombia. Silvia is the author of several peer-reviewed articles, book chapters and technical reports that explore the effect of education interventions on children’s academic and socio-emotional outcomes and the processes that support their development.
