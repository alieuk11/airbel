            <p>By bringing together field staff, designers, strategists, researchers and technical experts, we aim to uncover and
            nurture ideas that make a big impact on people’s safety, health, education, income and power.</p>
            <p>Innovation has always been the spirit of the International Rescue Committee. The early IRC — founded in 1933 at the call
            of Albert Einstein — invented new ways to help people escape the horrors of World War II. Today, our commitment to
            research and development is pioneering changes in products and processes that, in turn, are changing lives.</p>
