    standards of care. The IRC is developing a system that enables community health workers to diagnose and deliver
    lifesaving treatments to children, which does not require literacy or specialized skills. The IRC is also developing and
    testing new ideas that have a meaningful and sustainable impact on prevention of acute malnutrition."

            <mark class="bg-primary">The Airbel Impact Lab at IRC is a team of researchers, strategists and innovators committed to the accelerated design,
            rigorous evaluation and cost-effective scaling of the most impactful solutions supporting people affected by crisis.</mark>

          <div class="editable">
            <p>By bringing together field staff, designers, strategists, researchers and technical experts, we aim to uncover and
            nurture ideas that make a big impact on people’s safety, health, education, income and power.</p>
            <p>Innovation has always been the spirit of the International Rescue Committee. The early IRC — founded in 1933 at the call
            of Albert Einstein — invented new ways to help people escape the horrors of World War II. Today, our commitment to
            research and development is pioneering changes in products and processes that, in turn, are changing lives.</p>
