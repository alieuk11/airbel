#Apply for Support from the IRC Innovation Fund
##What is it?
The Innovation Fund provides flexible funding toward the development of innovative products, services or systems. Investments from the Innovation fund may support projects at any stage of maturity but should be catalytic in nature.

The Innovation Fund enables the kind of creativity, curiosity and risk-taking that are made difficult by stringent reporting requirements and donor restrictions.
